                        You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all images and other content contained in the flyer(s) you upload to the site, or you have all rights, licenses, consents, and releases that are necessary to grant to Peachjar the rights of such content, as contemplated under these Terms of Use; and (ii) neither the images and other content of the flyers you upload to the site, nor your posting, uploading, publication, submission, or transmittal of said flyers or Peachjar's use of such images and other content of said flyers (or any portion thereof) on, through or by means of the site, application and the services will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights, or other proprietary or intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy.

                    <h6>Schools and Parent Groups</h6>
                    <p class="small">
                        Posting and distributing informational flyers is offered as a free service to schools and each school’s authorized parent group(s). Peachjar encourages schools and parent groups to post and distribute all school-related, non-fee based flyers. If a flyer describes an activity or event with a fee, all of the following criteria must be met in order for the flyer to be posted without charge.</p>
                    <ul class="bullets">
                        <li class="small">

                    </p>
                    <h6>FLYER REVIEW AND PAYMENT POLICY</h6>
                    <p class="small">
                        External organizations uploading a flyer to the Enrichment Programs Section recognize their flyer is subject to review and approval by the school(s)/district(s) where they seek to post and distribute their flyer. In order for the school district to determine whether the organization's flyer meets school district requirements for flyer approval, the external organization's account information may be viewed by school district staff during the flyer approval process and as part of reports provided to school districts. The decision to approve or deny a flyer is solely determined by the controlling school(s)/district(s). Payment of Peachjar's flyer posting service fee is non-refundable once the transaction is completed. Should an external organization's flyer be denied, the posting organization will be notified electronically and a refund will be provided as an account credit after 24 hours. This delay enables the controlling school/district to undo their action and subsequently approve a flyer without the need for the external organization to repeat the uploading and checkout process. If the controlling school/district requests that a change be made to the submitted flyer, the external organization may click the “Return Credits” button on the “My Recent Flyers” page to immediately process an account credit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Peachjar does not verify the authenticity of information provided by posting organizations that is available for review by school district staff during the flyer approval process.</p>
